Craps:
	Dice Class
	Constructor to create new game
	Play method implementation
		2 dice objects
		First throw - win/loss
		Point rolls
		Return value
	Main Class
		Create game
		X Play 100000 times
		X Display Win %

Dice should be created as part of the constructor -- do not pass already-rolled values in.
There is a lot of printing happening --- that is not conducive to automating 100000 games.
